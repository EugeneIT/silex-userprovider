# About the roots

This is a fork of [jasongrimes/silex-simpleuser](https://github.com/jasongrimes/silex-simpleuser). it has been made one year after the abandonment of the original project. I will maintain and keep it up-to-date under this name. Until version 3.0 there should be complete compatibility.

# Licensing

The original library was developed by [jasongrimes](https://github.com/jasongrimes) under the BSD Clause-2 license. However, I wanted a transition to the LGPL v3.0, so please be aware of the fact that all codes from now on are released under the GNU LGPL v3.0. I try to make it as transparent as possible. 
_If you want to get sure that you only use the BSD licensed code, please use a version lower or equal 2.0.1._
